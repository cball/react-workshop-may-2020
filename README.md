# Basic React Repo

This repo leverages `react-scripts` (included in Create React App), but strips away most everything else to allow a focused environment for learning React concepts.

## Installation

- Clone this repo
- Run `yarn`
- copy `db-sample.json` and rename to `db.json`

## Running the server

- `yarn start` will run a react development server and a simple json api server that we can use to fetch data (see `db.json` and `json-server`).
